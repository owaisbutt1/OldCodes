    <P class="de">" <strong>On the other hand</strong> we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the mome
        nt,<del> so blinded by desire</del>that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their
         duty through weak ss of will<ins> which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain.</ins> These cases are perfectly ple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circu
        mstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."

               You can specify background images
            for any visible HTML element.
            In this example, the background image
            is specified for a p element.
            By default, the background-image
            will repeat itself in the direction(s)
            where it is smaller than the element
            where it is specified. (Try resizing the
